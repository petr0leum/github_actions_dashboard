# üìà Automated Stock Insights Dashboard

An interactive web dashboard that automates daily stock data fetching, analysis, and visualization using GitHub Actions. 

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically fetch stock data daily, perform basic analysis (like moving averages and trend detection), and generate visualizations. The results are displayed on a dynamic web page hosted with GitHub Pages, allowing users to interact with the data and explore different stocks.

### Key Features

- **Automated Data Fetching**: Retrieves daily stock data using APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance) without manual intervention.
- **Data Analysis**: Computes basic stock analytics, such as moving averages and trend indicators.
- **Interactive Web Dashboard**: Displays the latest stock data and visualizations, allowing users to select different stocks and view historical data.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Uses GitHub Actions to automate the entire workflow, from fetching data to publishing the web page.

## üìä Usage

### Accessing the Dashboard

The dashboard is automatically deployed using GitHub Pages. You can access it at:

[https://petr0leum.github.io/github_actions_dashboard/](https://petr0leum.github.io/github_actions_dashboard/)

### Interacting with the Dashboard

- **Select a Stock**: Use the dropdown menu to select different stocks.
- **View Analysis**: The page displays the latest data and analysis for the selected stock.
- **Run Custom Analysis**: Modify the scripts and push changes to see them reflected automatically on the dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally or contribute, you will need:

- **Python 3.10**: For data fetching and analysis scripts.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **GitHub Account**: To clone the repository and use GitHub Actions.
- **Basic Knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: To understand and modify the web interface.

## ü§ñ How GitHub Actions Works

The project uses GitHub Actions to automate the following steps:

1. **Fetch Stock Data**: A Python script fetches daily stock data from a financial API.
2. **Analyze Data**: The data is processed, and key metrics are calculated (e.g., moving averages).
3. **Generate Visualizations**: Plots and visualizations are generated and saved.
4. **Publish Results**: The updated data and visualizations are committed back to the repository and published to GitHub Pages.

### Workflow File

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/stock_analysis.yml`. It is triggered daily at 1 AM UTC and can also be run manually.

## üåü Future Improvements

- **Add More Advanced Analytics**: Implement additional analysis, like volatility, RSI, or Bollinger Bands.
- **Real-Time Data Updates**: Integrate real-time data fetching and visualization using WebSockets.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to log in and save their stock preferences.
- **Custom Alerts**: Notify users when specific stock conditions are met (e.g., price drops below a certain threshold).
